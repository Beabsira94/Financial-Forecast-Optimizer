# Financial News Sentiment and Stock Market Correlation Analysis

## Project Overview

This study focuses on analyzing a vast amount of financial news data in-depth in order to determine how news sentiment and stock market movements are related. By mimicking the deadlines and pressures common to the financial analytics industry, this challenge aims to improve abilities in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE). You will improve your capacity to evaluate intricate data sets, exhibit flexibility, and use creative thinking by working on this project.

## Business Objective

By utilizing cutting-edge data analysis techniques, Nova Financial Solutions hopes to dramatically increase the accuracy of its financial forecasts and the efficiency of its operations. It is your responsibility as a data analyst to thoroughly analyze the financial news dataset with two main objectives in mind:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Measure the tone and sentiment of financial news by doing sentiment analysis on news headlines. In order to comprehend the emotional context surrounding stock-related news, this entails applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to compute sentiment ratings and connect them with appropriate stock symbols.

2. **Correlation Analysis** : Determine statistical relationships between the sentiment gleaned from news stories and the appropriate fluctuations in stock prices. Monitor changes in stock prices around the time of publication and examine how news sentiment affects stock performance. Investment techniques based on the correlation between news sentiment and stock price swings are informed by this data.

## Dataset Overview

The **Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID)** is designed to enhance stock market predictions by combining quantitative and qualitative data. The dataset includes:

- **headline**: The title of the news article, often highlighting key financial actions like stock performance, price target changes, or company earnings.
- **url**: The direct link to the full news article.
- **publisher**: The author or creator of the article.
- **date**: The publication date and time, including timezone information (UTC-4).
- **stock**: The stock ticker symbol, which is a unique series of letters assigned to a publicly traded company (e.g., AAPL for Apple).


## Conclusion

This research offers substantial value in boosting forecasting accuracy and operating efficiency in financial markets by deepening understanding of fundamental financial analytic approaches and enhancing predictive analytics capabilities.
